		<h1>Utah National Parks Map</h1>
		<h2>The following places are clickable:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Zion</li>
			<li>Arches</li>
			<li>Timpanagos Cave</li>
			<li>Capitol Reef</li>
			<li>Canyonlands</li>
			<li>Bryce Canyon</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		I chose these parts of the maps because I think the National Parks in Utah are an amazing part of the state. I have heard so much about them, but since I've lived here I haven't had a change to visit any yet. I also built the site as a resource for myself, hopefully having sometime this summer to visit a few of these locations!
