						<div><img src="img/tb1.jpg"><p>Based on Claudia P. Tambussi, Ricardo de Mendoza, Federico J. Degrange, and Mariana B. Picasso's work, the phorusrhacid's neck can be divided into three main regions. In the higher regions of the neck, the phorusrhacid has bifurcate neural spines (BNS), while it has high neural spines in its lower regions. This suggests that the phorusrhacid had a highly flexible and developed neck allowing it to carry its heavy head and strike with terrifying speed and power. Although the phorusrhacid externally looks like it has a short neck, its flexible skeletal neck structure proves that it could expand farther beyond the expected reach and intimidate its prey using its height, allowing it to strike more easily. Once stretched out into its full length in preparation for a downward strike, its developed neck muscles and heavy head could produce enough momentum and power to cause fatal damage to the terror bird's prey.</p></div>
						<div><img src="img/tb2.png"><p>Most phorusrhacids were very fast runners. All members possessed a large, sharp beak, a powerful neck and sharp talons. However, even with these attributes, the phorusrhacids are often assumed to have preyed on relatively small animals (about the size of a rabbit) that could be dispatched with a minimum of struggle. This is due to the fact that with the phorusrhacids' beak proportions, the jaw could not generate a great deal of bite force with which to kill the prey. This is disputable as many big-game hunting predators such as Smilodon, great white sharks and Allosaurus have weaker bite forces and often laterally weak skulls as adaptations towards, not away from, killing large prey, relying instead on the 	presence of a cutting edge, a wide gape made possible by the reduction of jaw musculature, and the driving force of the body or neck.[20][21] Since phorusrhacids share many of the same adaptations, such as a large, laterally flattened skull with a sharp-edged beak and powerful neck musculature, it is possible that they were specialized predators of relatively large prey.</p></div>
						<div><img src="img/tb3.png"><p>When the Isthmus of Panama emerged, 2.7 million years ago, carnivorous dogs, bears, and cats from North America were able to cross into South America, increasing competition.[25] (They had been preceded by procyonids as early as 7.3 million years ago.[5]) The population of phorusrhacids declined thereafter, suggesting that competition with newly arrived predators was a major contributor to their extinction.[26] Similar ideas have been considered for sparassodonts and for South America's terrestrial sebecid crocodilians.</p></div>
