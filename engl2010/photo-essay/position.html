		<h1>Heroin Should be Legal</h1>
		<h2>Alex Field</h2>
			<p>What if I told you that there is a problem in the US, and its killing six times as many people <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/index.html">since 1999?</a> This is a subject that is close to home for me. For seven years before I started going back to school, I worked in drug and alcohol treatment centers. From my experience, most of my patients were under 25, and almost all patients, of all ages, were addicted to heroin. Nearly all the patients that I saw over those seven years began their journey on prescription opioids, many for a legitimate and legal reason. Once these people turned to heroin, they were lost from the system and driven underground. Now instead of interacting with doctors for help, their best chance was with law enforcement. And many of those interactions were about punishment rather than help. </p>
			<p>Heroin overdose is a growing health risk in the US. According to Steven Reinberg in a 2017 <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20170329/heroin-epidemic-expands-its-grip-on-america#1">article</a> from WebMD, “Opioid overdose kills about 78 people a day in the United States. In 2015, more than 33,000 died of opioid overdoses, which was a record high, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.” Year after year new records are hit in this area. Given that this is a six-fold increase in deaths, that means back in 1999, fewer than 6,000 people died a year from overdoes. It begs the question, how are so many more people on heroin now than 20 years ago?</p>
			<p>Correspondingly, abuse of prescription opioids has led to the heroin crisis. Over the years the amount of people prescribed to opioids has increased. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581144">From 1999 to 2011</a>, consumption of hydrocodone more than doubled and consumption of oxycodone increased by nearly 500%. Once people are addicted to these drugs, they then search out ways to be them illegally. Maybe they need more than their prescription covers, or their doctors have cut them off. The next step in this process is to find heroin, the much cheaper alternative. This leads down the path of reason like: ‘Why am I paying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/health/prescription-painkillers-seen-as-a-gateway-to-heroin.html">$1 per milligram</a> for oxy when for a tenth of the price I can get an equivalent dose of heroin?’</p>
			<p>One of the biggest concerns with heroin, besides its addictive and harmful potential, is this means by which it is used, intravenously. This means that the user injects the drug directly into their vein, bringing along a whole host of possible communicable diseases and new injuries. This unsafe usage becomes a huge public health risk. People who use needles to inject drugs are at the highest risk for acquiring Hepatitis C. For every  one person who is injecting drugs and has been infected with Hep C, they are likely to infect <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/heroin/overview">20 other people</a>. These are staggering numbers, and besides the way an overdose death can affect a community, we can see other ways that this is also a public health concern.</p>
			<p>A radical solution to these issues may be a tough pill to swallow, legalize or at the very least, decriminalize the use of heroin. We have seen the snowball effect of what an decade of people over using opioid medication, turned to heroin users, has done to our communities, now we need to make steps in a direction to do something about it. Rather than drive these people underground, for fear of being arrested and stigmatized by the community, I believe that it is time to work for new solutions towards helping these people. Ideas like this have been tested in other countries, from full legalization of drugs, to decriminalizing small amounts and making safe needle exchanges. In an article from April 2017, NPR reported that Portugal’s heroin cases have seen a “<a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/524380027?storyId=524380027?storyId=524380027">…75 percent drop</a> from the 1990s. Portugal's drug-induced death rate has plummeted to five times lower than the European Union average.” Providing users safe spaces can give them resources for treatment, as well as slowing the spread of disease and incidence of fatal overdose.</p>
			<p>Community services like Insite have been providing these safe spaces. In a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/is-vancouvers-safe-drug-use-site-a-good-model-for-seattle/">report</a> by the Seattle Times in May 2017, “Statistics show Insite has saved lives, proponents say, reversing nearly 5,000 overdoses since 2003, with no deaths. At the same time, studies show the center has prevented the spread of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C, and reduced dangerous litter including needles strewn on local streets.” Given the amount of deaths, and how likely the spread of disease is, new paradigms on helping and accessing these people, through our laws and public policies may be our only hope.</p>
			<p>Conversely, there are arguments on the other side of this that say these drugs are dangerous and killing people, they shouldn’t be legal. But as we can clearly see, legal drugs like prescription opioids are already killing people, or at least at the root cause of why people are eventually dying from these drugs. Of course, drugs are dangerous, but that isn’t stopping millions of people every year from getting their hands on some type of them. There are also arguments of moral failings on the part of the users, but I think this is simply not a sympathetic approach. The most compelling arguments I found to the contrary were from a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/20/15328384/opioid-epidemic-drug-legalization">Vox article</a> by German Lopez. To summarize his position, would be to say that the government’s handling and regulation of industries like alcohol and tobacco has been so poorly handled, that there would be no way that our lawmakers could reasonable deal with laws and regulations around hard drugs. For example, the legal and regulated drug of tobacco kills at least a half a million people annually. While I think this is an understandable position, I think that we are seeing the opioid trend become more dangerous in a smaller time frame, and also we are dealing with a much more advanced medical community, not the one that was practically promoting smoking in the early 1900s.</p>
			<p>Whether you are for or against decriminalizing or legalizing heroin, you must admit that our country is in a grave state when it comes to the opioid crisis. If I can convince you of one that last thing, its at the end of the day, opioid users are humans. They are our mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters. They deserve the help and respect that all humans do. Would you rather have your family member behind bars or being exposed to safe and alternative treatments?</p>
