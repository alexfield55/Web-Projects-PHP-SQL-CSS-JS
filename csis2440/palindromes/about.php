				I really liked working on this project. I think that I learned a lot about the process of building a site from the ground up, and all the intricacies and ins and outs of that process. I got the feeling that this is somewhat what developement feels like in the real world. All things considered I really enjoyed working on this project.

				I think one of my struggles come from working along in class (cue "I told you so"). Althought I am not sure that it was necessarily from following along, I think it was partially from losing track of what my code was doing. I can go back through it and figure it out, but I think if I had started from the ground up I could have done it more quickly, then going back and trying to refactor my code to meet assignment requirments (hence it being late). I do appreciate that all being a part of my own learning process of what works best for me.
